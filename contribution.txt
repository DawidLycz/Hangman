pip changes:

    To solidify the implementation of changes in the script, 
    after making modifications in the code, you should enter the following command in the terminal:

        python setup.py bdist_wheel

        (if doesn't work install wheel: pip install wheel)

    You can check if everythig works as i should by quicly install wheel with command:
    
        pip install dist\Hangman-1.0-py3-none-any.whl

    After that, you can push reposytory to Github and you can export project to the .exe extension.

python to exe conversion (no new files):

    Assuming there is no new files outside of data directory, it can be converted based on Hangman.spec file.
    Tool that might be used for that is pyinstaller, that can be simply obtained by command:

        pip install pyinstaller

    After that, game can be simply converted by input off following command to terminal:

        pyinstaller Hangman.spec 

    If everything went well, game directory should appear in dist directory.

python to exe conversion (new files):

    However, if game now contains new files, for example new modules, it is necessery to convert it manually.
    There are multiple ways to do this, but I recommend using the "auto-py-to-exe" module.
    You can easily obtain it by installing it through pip: 

        pip install auto-py-to-exe
    
    After installation, you can run the converter by entering its name in the terminal:

        auto-py-to-exe

    Once the application window pops up, you just need to input the correct data and start the conversion process. 

Installer creation:

    When game is already in .exe format. You might want to create installer. 
    Tool that might help with this process is Inno Setup Complier.
